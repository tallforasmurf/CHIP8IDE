    CHIP-8 IDE ASSEMBLY PHASE ONE

This is a sub-module of the source.py module, which implements the source
editor window.

The code here implements the initial assembly syntax check, in which we
verify the syntactic/lexical validity of a statement and when it is valid, we
record some useful information about it. It is also responsible for creating
a Statement object to save data about the statement.

This is called from the QSyntaxHighlighter attached to the edit document.
Each time a line is modified, even by one keystroke, the Syntax Highlighter
calls phase_one() below.

A number of errors are caught here and recorded in the Statement object. When
errors are noted, the Syntax Highlighter colors the statement pink in the
edit window.

When the statement text is valid, the Statement object has the info needed to
complete the assembly later, during the assemble() function of the assemble2
module.

    Tokenization by Regular Expression

Refer to https://docs.python.org/dev/library/re.html#writing-a-tokenizer for
some insight into what's going on here. TL;DR: we set up a list of named
regular expressions, one to recognize each valid token form that can occur.

We use the pypi module regex which is faster and has more features than the
standard re. (Although no special regex features are used, so the standard
re module would work. Just not quite as fast. And we need to be fast, because
the regexes get exercised for EVERY FUCKING KEYSTROKE in the editor. Really.)

Regex coding notes: all have the ignore-case flag, so capitalization doesn't
matter. The regex for each specific directive or opcode word is fenced with
the \b word-break test. That avoids seeing opcodes at the start or end of
innocent labels.
'''
import regex

'''
List of Directive opcodes. A search for these is the first item in the
tokenizer regex. Initially that was done as a hack to recognize the ORG
directive ahead of the search for the OR opcode. However that is no longer an
issue since I inserted the \b markers.

'''

Define and name the legal token types, each as a tuple (token-class-name,
regex-to-match-it).

Most of these are specific matches, for example the LABEL class matches only
to a word plus colon at the head of the line.

The three classes DIRECTIVE, OPCODE and VREG are composed by |-joining the
items in one of the groups above to form a compound ( rex1 | rex2 | ... ).

Notes re the STRING regex. It only recognizes the use of 'single' quotes; it
will not recognize double-quotes. It does recognize a null string (which will
eventually be assembled as a DS 0 directive). The assembler doc says that to
include a single quote, double it: 'MA''AM'. In tokenizing, that just
resolves to two string tokens, STRING(MA) and STRING(AM). While processing
tokens we note this and glue them back together as STRING(MA'AM).
'''

Transform the token_specs list into one massive regex of the form,

that is, an or-alternation of named match groups. The result is not something
a human would like to edit, but the regex module handles it just fine.

Given that this massive regex is applied every keystroke, one can see how
good performance by regex is important.

'''

    Regexes for statement recognition

After tokenizing the statement using the above, we process the recognized
tokens in sequence to build up a synopsis, or signature, of the statement.

The signature is composed of one, or a few, fixed characters per token, so it
represents a summary of the token classes in the statement. There are a
limited number of signatures possible, and any statement whose signature is
not one of them, is automatically invalid.

Labels and comments are not reflected in the signature. OPCODE and DIRECTIVE
tokens go in as themselves ('LD', 'ORG'). Other token types are converted to
the single letters in the following table. Any token that could be part of an
expression is represented as 'V'. (The actual validity of an expression is
determined in a separate step.)

Thus the signature for "ld v5,31" is "LDR,V" (opcode LD, R for the register,
comma for the comma, V for the decimal token). Any other valid load-register
statement would have the same signature.

'''

summary_chars = {
    'VREG'    : 'R',
    'IREG'    : 'I',
    'KREG'    : 'K',
    'DTREG'   : 'T',
    'DSREG'   : 'S',
    'COMMA'   : ',',
    'WORD'    : 'V',
    'DECIMAL' : 'V',
    'HEX'     : 'V',
    'OCTAL'   : 'V',
    'BINARY'  : 'V',
    'STRING'  : 'Z',
    'EXPOPS'  : 'V'
    }

'''

The signatures of the valid statements that do not end with an expression are
simple literals. For quick recognition these are filed in this dict. The key
is the signature string; and the value, a code for the instruction format.

'''
signature_dict = {
    'ADDI,R' : 'ADDI',
    'ADDR,R' : 'ADDR',
    'ANDR,R' : 'AND',
    'CLS'    : 'CLS',
    'EXIT'   : 'EXIT',

    'SUBNR,R' : 'SUBN',
    'XORR,R' : 'XOR'
    }

'''
The remaining possible signatures end in varying amounts of expression
values. We use regexes to recognize these.

Constructed similarly to the token regex above, this regex recognizes only
valid signatures. The name of a match is a code for that instruction format.

The regex is applied with re.fullmatch() so these expressions are
implicitly '^..$'.

    Assembly-time Symbol Table

Expressions in statements are translated into Python expressions. Each WORD
token in an expression (which is a reference to some label) is translated
into a call on LOOKUP(word).

The name LOOKUP is resolved as a global at the time the eval() function is
applied to evaluate the expression. When that is done in the namespace of
this module, LOOKUP() is the following, which just returns 1 (to avoid
unintentional divide-by-zero errors).

During the real assembly (in the assembler2 module), LOOKUP is defined to
return the actual value of the word, or None if it is not defined.

'''

def LOOKUP( name:str ) -> int :
    return 1

'''
    Parsing Phase 1: Recognition

For this application we do not need to parse a general-purpose language, but
only recognize a relatively small set of valid statement forms. The only
complicated part is that we are supposed to support expressions. Both the
CHIPPER assembler and Jeffrey Bian's MOCHI-8 assembler support general
expressions, so presumably there are CHIP-8 source programs around that use
them. Probably 99% of all expressions are:

* a single literal value like #02f or $10001000
* a single name like DO_SUB
* two values with one operator between,like NAME & #0f.

Nevertheless we need to handle ones like (to concoct a ridiculous example),

    LD V2, (BUFEND - BUFSIZE) & ( #073 < 2 ) % 7

I considered taking this as an opportunity to write my own parser for
expressions -- but that would be masochism. There are only cosmetic
differences between CHIPPER literals and Python ones (#073 vs. 0x073, etc),
and a couple of operators use different characters. Once those are
translated, we can use Python's perfectly good parser to validate them and
(in the assemble2 phase) Python's eval to evaluate them.

So, phase 1 of parsing proceeds in these steps:

    * Initialize the Statement object for parsing.

    * Tokenize the statement with the t_rex regex, producing a list
      of tokens.

    * Strip off a label (LABEL, or WORD EQU), noting the label in S.defined_name

    * Strip off a COMMENT token, which will be the last one if it exists.

    * If there are no tokens left (statement was only a label and/or a comment)
      set S.is_valid and return.

    * Scan the remaining list of tokens to do two things:

      - Build a signature of the statement.

      - Save the tokens of expression operands as lists of tokens.

    * Check the signature against signature_dict and signature_regex. If it
      doesn't match, the statement is bad. Return S with is_valid False.

    * Store the form of the statement yielded by signature_dict/signature_regex.

    * Convert any expression(s) into Python form and apply the built in Python
      compile() to them.

    * If compile() reports an error, return S with is_valid False.

    * Store the code object(s) returned by compile() in S.expressions for
      use at assembly time.

    * Set the assembled length of the instruction based on opcode and operands.

    * Return S with is_valid True.

Error handling: a number of errors are detected. For each we leave a message
text in S.error_msg and, when we know it, the index of the start of the bad
token in S.error_pos. It is up to the caller to convey this info to the user.
(The Syntax Highlighter makes the statement pink and the editor puts the
error text in the status line.)

    The statement looks valid so far, but we have not actually parsed the

    For each expression, translate the tokens to Python syntax to form a Python
    expression text. Use the built-in compile() function to parse and convert
    that to a code-object that can be evaluated later.

    Literals need only a cosmetic brush-up except two cases: string literals,
    need to be uppercased and converted to bytes('string',encoding=ASCII).
    Decimal literals need to be checked for the peculiar problem that Python
    3 does not allow a leading zero on a literal because that would have been
    an octal literal under Python 2. So get rid of leading zeros on decimals.

    Names are converted into calls on the LOOKUP() function. The one in this
    module returns 1 for any name, so a compiled expression can be evaluated
    at this time. (Returns 1 so that in case the user wrote "NAME1/NAME2" we
    do not cause a divide-by-zero.)
